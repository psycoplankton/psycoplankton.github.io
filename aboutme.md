Hey There! Myself Vansh. I am currently pursuing my dual degree in Engineering Physics from Indian Institute of Technology, (Banaras Hindu University), Varanasi. My research interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing. I have also worked with Generative Adversarial Networks in the past and have a good idea of Computer Vision as well. Particularly, I am interested in application of Graphs and Reinforcement Learning in Natural Language Understanding. I believe incorporation of Graphs as a knowledge base for LLMs and using reinforcement learning principles to design more robust agents can help design better agents.
I am also interested in Physics Informed Neural Networks. 

I have previously worked with [Dr. Prof. Sanjay Kumar Singh](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/skscse) and [Dr. Prof. Vandana Bharti](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/user-profile/vandana-bharti) on GraphGANs and Fuzzy Nueral Networks. Currently, I am working under [Dr. Prof. Chng Eng Siong](https://aseschng.github.io/default.html) at Speech and Language Lab, at NTU Singapore. Also I am working at a startup [BingeClip](https://www.bingeclip.ai/) working on inference pipeline optimization. You can check out my latest work [here](https://psycoplankton.github.io/projects/)

Apart from this, I am a chocolate lover and this will likely be the cause of my having diabeties in the future :neutral_face:. However, I hit the gym 4-5 times a week just so I can keep eating chocolate truffles and choco brownie ice creams. I like to keep myself busy, so that i do not spend my time overthinking. I also write articles on medium.
